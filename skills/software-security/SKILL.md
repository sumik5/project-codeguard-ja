# Software Security Skill (Project CodeGuard)
This skill provides comprehensive security guidance to help AI coding agents generate secure code and prevent common vulnerabilities. It is based on **Project CodeGuard**, an open-source, model-agnostic security framework that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding workflows.

## When to Use This Skill
This skill should be activated when:
- Writing new code in any language
- Reviewing or modifying existing code
- Implementing security-sensitive features (authentication, cryptography, data handling, etc.)
- Working with user input, databases, APIs, or external services
- Configuring cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or containers
- Handling sensitive data, credentials, or cryptographic operations

## How to Use This Skill
When writing or reviewing code:
1. Always-Apply Rules: Some rules MUST be checked on every code operation:
- `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials.md` - Never hardcode secrets, passwords, API keys, or tokens
- `codeguard-1-crypto-algorithms.md` - Use only modern, secure cryptographic algorithms
- `codeguard-1-digital-certificates.md` - Validate and manage digital certificates securely
- `codeguard-1-safe-c-functions.md` - Avoid unsafe C/C++ functions and use safe alternatives
2. Context-Specific Rules: Apply rules from /rules directory based on the language of the feature being implemented using the table given below:

3. Proactive Security: Don't just avoid vulnerabilities-actively implement secure patterns:
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Apply least-privilege principles
- Use modern cryptographic algorithms and libraries
- Implement defense-in-depth strategies

## CodeGuard Security Rules
The security rules are available in the `rules/` directory.

### Usage Workflow
When generating or reviewing code, follow this workflow:

### 1. Initial Security Check
Before writing any code:
- Check: Will this handle credentials? → Apply codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials
- Check: What language am I using? → Identify applicable language-specific rules
- Check: What security domains are involved? → Load relevant rule files

### 2. Code Generation
While writing code:
- Apply secure-by-default patterns from relevant Project CodeGuard rules
- Add security-relevant comments explaining choices

### 3. Security Review
After writing code:
- Review against implementation checklists in each rule
- Verify no hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Validate that all the rules have been successfully followed when applicable.
- Explain which security rules were applied
- Highlight security features implemented
