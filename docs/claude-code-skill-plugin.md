# CodeGuard Claude Code Plugin

## Overview

This document explains how Project CodeGuard is packaged as a Claude Code plugin (Agent Skill) and how to use it effectively in your AI-assisted coding workflows.

Project CodeGuard is an **open-source, model-agnostic security framework** that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding workflows. The plugin makes it easy to integrate these security rules with Claude Code.

## What is an Agent Skill?

Agent Skills are model-invoked capabilities that Claude autonomously uses based on task context. The CodeGuard security skill provides comprehensive security guidance that Claude applies automatically when writing, reviewing, or modifying code.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Basic familiarity with Claude Code's plugin system

### Installation Steps

1. **Add the Project CodeGuard marketplace:**
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add project-codeguard/rules
   ```

2. **Install the security plugin:**
   ```bash
   /plugin install codeguard-security@project-codeguard
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Code** (if prompted)

4. **Verify installation:**
   The skill is automatically loaded. Start coding and Claude will apply security rules automatically.

## How It Works

The CodeGuard skill integrates **22 security rule files** covering all major security domains across languages, frameworks, and technology stacks. The skill follows a simple but powerful workflow:

### Skill Activation

The skill activates automatically when:
- Writing new code in any language
- Reviewing or modifying existing code
- Implementing security-sensitive features (authentication, cryptography, data handling)
- Working with user input, databases, APIs, or external services
- Configuring cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or containers
- Handling sensitive data, credentials, or cryptographic operations

### Security Workflow

When generating or reviewing code, Claude follows this 3-step workflow:

**1. Initial Security Check**
- Will this handle credentials? → Apply `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials`
- What language is being used? → Identify applicable language-specific rules
- What security domains are involved? → Load relevant rule files

**2. Code Generation**
- Apply secure-by-default patterns from relevant CodeGuard rules
- Add security-relevant comments explaining choices

**3. Security Review**
- Review against implementation checklists in each rule
- Verify no hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Validate that all applicable rules have been followed
- Explain which security rules were applied
- Highlight security features implemented

### Rule Categories

**Always-Apply Rules** (4 critical rules checked on every code operation):
- `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials` - Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- `codeguard-1-crypto-algorithms` - Use modern cryptographic algorithms
- `codeguard-1-digital-certificates` - Validate certificate security
- `codeguard-1-safe-c-functions` - Replace unsafe C/C++ functions

**Context-Specific Rules** (18 rules applied based on technology and features):
- Input validation, authentication, authorization, APIs, data storage, privacy, logging, cryptography, file handling, serialization, supply chain, DevOps, cloud, Kubernetes, IaC, frameworks, and mobile security

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Writing Database Code

```python
# Claude will automatically use parameterized queries
def get_user(email):
    # Secure pattern following codeguard-0-input-validation-injection
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?"
    return cursor.execute(query, (email,))
```

### Example 2: Handling API Keys

```javascript
// Claude will prevent hardcoded credentials
// and suggest environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error("STRIPE_API_KEY not configured");
}
```

### Example 3: Password Hashing

```python
# Claude will suggest modern password hashing
from argon2 import PasswordHasher
ph = PasswordHasher()
password_hash = ph.hash(password)
```

### Example 4: File Upload Security

```javascript
// Claude will enforce file validation
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 5MB limit
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Validate file type by content, not just extension
    if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
      cb(null, true);
    } else {
      cb(new Error('Only images allowed'));
    }
  }
});
```

## Team Deployment

For organizations, deploy CodeGuard to all developers automatically:

1. Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "marketplaces": [{"source": "project-codeguard/rules"}],
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "codeguard-security",
         "marketplace": "project-codeguard",
         "enabled": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Team members trust the repository folder

3. CodeGuard installs automatically for everyone

## All Security Rules

The plugin includes 22 comprehensive security rules organized into two categories:

### Always-Apply Rules (4 rules)

These critical rules are checked on **every** code operation:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials` | Prevent secrets, passwords, API keys, tokens in source code |
| `codeguard-1-crypto-algorithms` | Ban weak algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, DES); use modern alternatives |
| `codeguard-1-digital-certificates` | Validate certificate expiration, key strength, signature algorithms |
| `codeguard-1-safe-c-functions` | Replace unsafe C/C++ functions (gets, strcpy, strcat, sprintf) |

### Context-Specific Rules (18 rules)

These rules apply based on the programming language, framework, or feature being implemented. Claude automatically selects relevant rules based on context:

| Security Domain | Rules |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Input & Injection** | `codeguard-0-input-validation-injection` |
| **Authentication** | `codeguard-0-authentication-mfa` |
| **Authorization** | `codeguard-0-authorization-access-control` |
| **Sessions** | `codeguard-0-session-management-and-cookies` |
| **APIs & Web** | `codeguard-0-api-web-services`, `codeguard-0-client-side-web-security` |
| **Data & Privacy** | `codeguard-0-data-storage`, `codeguard-0-privacy-data-protection`, `codeguard-0-logging` |
| **Cryptography** | `codeguard-0-additional-cryptography` |
| **Files & Serialization** | `codeguard-0-file-handling-and-uploads`, `codeguard-0-xml-and-serialization` |
| **Infrastructure** | `codeguard-0-supply-chain-security`, `codeguard-0-devops-ci-cd-containers`, `codeguard-0-cloud-orchestration-kubernetes`, `codeguard-0-iac-security` |
| **Platforms** | `codeguard-0-framework-and-languages`, `codeguard-0-mobile-apps` |

> **Note:** Each rule file contains detailed guidance, checklists, and examples. Claude references these automatically based on the code context.

## Updating

To update to the latest security rules:

```bash
/plugin update codeguard-security@project-codeguard
```

## Customization

### Disabling the Plugin

If needed, temporarily disable:

```bash
/plugin disable codeguard-security@project-codeguard
```

Re-enable:

```bash
/plugin enable codeguard-security@project-codeguard
